Time-locked USDC vaults on Soroban with auto-routed AMM yield.

## Abstract

YieldLadder is a savings primitive on the Stellar network. A user deposits USDC into one of four time-locked vaults (Flex, 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month) and receives a non-transferable position representing their share. The protocol routes deposited USDC into a curated set of Stellar AMM liquidity pools, harvests trading fees on a fixed cadence, compounds harvested yield back into the position, and distributes yield proportional to share weight and lock duration.

The protocol is non-custodial and immutable per deployment. Yield is sourced exclusively from on-chain Stellar liquidity pools — no off-chain CeFi venues, no anchor lending, no rehypothecation. The only privileged role is the Strategist, who can propose new pool allocations subject to a 72-hour timelock and a hard-coded per-pool exposure cap.

## Vault tiers

| Tier | Lock duration | Lock multiplier | Early-exit fee | Min deposit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flex | None | 1.00x | 0% | 1 USDC |
| L3 | 3 months | 1.05x | 0.50% | 50 USDC |
| L6 | 6 months | 1.15x | 1.25% | 100 USDC |
| L12 | 12 months | 1.40x | 3.00% | 250 USDC |

Lock multipliers apply at the share-weight level: a 100 USDC deposit into L12 receives 140 share-units, while the same deposit into Flex receives 100. Yield distributes pro-rata against share-units, so longer-lock depositors capture a structurally larger fraction of harvested fees. Early-exit fees are charged against principal and redistributed to remaining depositors in the same tier — they are not retained by the protocol.

```

The Vault Router is the user-facing contract; it enforces tier rules and mints position records. Each tier vault holds depositor balances and a reference to the Strategy Vault, which holds the protocol's working capital and executes pool allocations. The Harvester is a permissionless contract — anyone can call `harvest()` after the cooldown elapses and receive a 10 bps bounty on harvested yield.

## Vault mechanics

### Deposit and positions

Users call `deposit(tier, amount)` on the Vault Router. The router transfers USDC into the tier vault, records `shares = amount * lock_multiplier` against the user's address, sets `lock_until = now + tier.duration` for locked tiers, and forwards USDC to the Strategy Vault for allocation. Positions are non-transferable and identified by wallet address — there are no fungible position tokens.

### Yield accrual and withdrawal

Yield accrues continuously at the AMM layer and is realised at each harvest. Harvested USDC is automatically re-deployed into the Strategy Vault, compounding yield without any user action. At maturity, users call `withdraw(tier)` and receive principal plus all accrued yield with no fee. Before maturity, `early_exit(tier)` returns principal minus the exit fee plus accrued yield; the exit fee is socialised across remaining depositors in the same tier.

## Yield sources

YieldLadder allocates exclusively to Stellar AMM pools that meet all of the following criteria:

- USDC is one of the two assets in the pool
- Counterparty asset is on the protocol allowlist (currently: XLM, EURC, AQUA)
- Pool has at least 30 days of trading history
- Pool has at least $250,000 TVL at allocation time
- Per-pool exposure is capped at 35% of Strategy Vault assets

The Strategist can propose adding pools or counterparty assets via the governance contract, subject to a 72-hour timelock. Current allocations are published at `https://yieldladder.dev/allocations` and on-chain via `Strategy.allocations()`.

## Risk model

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Smart contract | Contracts are immutable — bugs cannot be patched in place | External audit, formal verification of lock and share accounting |
| Impermanent loss | AMM allocation exposes principal to IL when pool asset prices diverge | Allowlist restricted to low-volatility pairs; per-pool exposure capped; IL tracked and rebalanced above threshold |
| Stablecoin depeg | Material USDC depeg directly affects every position | No hedge; users should size deposits accordingly |
| Strategist | Strategist can propose allocation changes but cannot withdraw user funds | 72-hour timelock, Guardian Multisig veto, hard-coded exposure caps |

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9+

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LadderMine/yieldladder.git
cd yieldladder
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd app
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # starts on http://localhost:3000
```

**Contracts:**

```bash
# Add the wasm target if you haven't already
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Build all contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow this workflow:

1. **Open an issue first** for any non-trivial change so the approach can be discussed before you invest time coding.
2. **Fork the repository** and create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g. `fix/harvester-cooldown`, `feat/l3-vault-tests`).
3. **Make your changes.** Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit.
4. **Ensure CI passes.** The CI pipeline runs `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` for the frontend, and `cargo build` for contracts. Run these locally before pushing.
5. **Open a pull request** against `main` with a clear title and description. Reference any related issue with `closes #N`.

### Code conventions

- **Rust:** follow standard `rustfmt` formatting (`cargo fmt` before committing). Document public items with `///` doc comments.
- **TypeScript:** the frontend uses the TypeScript strict mode. Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify.
- **Commit messages:** use the `type: description` format — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`.

## SDK

```typescript
import { YieldLadder } from '@yieldladder/sdk';

const yl = new YieldLadder({ network: 'mainnet', signer });

await yl.deposit({ tier: 'L6', amount: '500.00' });

const position = await yl.position(userAddress);
// { tier: 'L6', principal: '500.00', shares: '575',
//   accruedYield: '12.34', lockUntil: 1781856000 }

await yl.withdraw({ tier: 'L6' });    // throws if lock not expired
await yl.earlyExit({ tier: 'L6' });   // succeeds, charges 1.25% fee
```

The SDK source lives in `sdks/typescript/` and targets `@stellar/stellar-sdk` v12+ with Soroban support.
